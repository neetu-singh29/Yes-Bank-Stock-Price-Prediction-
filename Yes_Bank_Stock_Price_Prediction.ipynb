        "**Summary:** The Yes Bank Stock Price Prediction project aims to develop an effective machine learning model to forecast stock prices using historical data. Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatility of financial markets, the influence of multiple economic factors, and the impact of external events. By leveraging data science techniques, this project attempts to build predictive models that help investors and traders make informed decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Objective:**\n",
        "The primary objective of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical stock price data of Yes Bank and predict future stock trends. The project evaluates different regression models to determine the most accurate model for forecasting. The models used include:\n",
        "✅ Linear Regression\n",
        "✅ Random Forest Regressor\n",
        "✅ Gradient Boosting Regressor\n",
        "\n",
        "These models are assessed based on performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R²), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Additionally, hyperparameter tuning techniques such as GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV are employed to optimize the models for better predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps Involved in the Project:**\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset includes historical stock prices of Yes Bank with features like Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.\n",
        "Data cleaning steps such as handling missing values, outliers, and feature selection are performed.\n",
        "The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model development.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**\n",
        "\n",
        "Statistical analysis of stock price movements is conducted.\n",
        "Visualizations like time series plots, correlation heatmaps, and moving averages are used to understand trends and patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **Model Implementation & Evaluation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Linear Regression:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A simple model used as a baseline for comparison.\n",
        "Performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "MSE: 0.1114\n",
        "\n",
        "R²: 0.5470\n",
        "\n",
        "MAE: 0.2687\n",
        "\n",
        "Hyperparameter tuning was done using GridSearchCV, but the model did not show significant improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Random Forest Regressor:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A more advanced ensemble model to capture non-linear relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "MSE: 0.1339\n",
        "\n",
        "R²: 0.4556\n",
        "\n",
        "MAE: 0.1575\n",
        "\n",
        "RandomizedSearchCV was used to fine-tune hyperparameters, leading to improved accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Gradient Boosting Regressor:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A boosting algorithm that improves predictions through iterative learning.\n",

        "\n",
        "MAE: 0.1505\n",
        "\n",
        "GridSearchCV was applied for hyperparameter optimization, enhancing results slightly.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **Model Explainability & Feature Importance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Feature importance analysis using SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) and permutation importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Identified key factors affecting stock prices, such as opening price, previous day's close, and trading volume.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting stock prices. The ***Linear Regression model performed the best*** among the tested models in terms of R², but ensemble models like ***Random Forest and Gradient Boosting provided more robust predictions*** by capturing complex patterns in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the predictions are useful, stock markets are highly dynamic, and external factors like economic policies, global financial trends, and investor sentiment can significantly impact prices.\n",

        "3️⃣ **f_regression:** This is the scoring function used by SelectKBest. It calculates the F-statistic between each feature and the target variable (Close price). Higher F-statistic values indicate a stronger linear relationship with the target, suggesting greater importance.\n",
