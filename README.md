** Yes Bank Stock Price Prediction ** 

📌 Project Overview

The Yes Bank Stock Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning-based model to predict the stock price of Yes Bank using historical stock data. Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of financial markets and various influencing factors. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze past stock trends and forecast future prices.

🔍 Problem Statement

Stock market investments require a thorough analysis of price trends and market behavior. Investors face difficulties in predicting stock prices due to market volatility. This project seeks to create a predictive model for Yes Bank’s stock price using historical data and various machine learning techniques. The objective is to determine the most accurate and reliable model to assist investors in making informed decisions.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains historical stock price data for Yes Bank.

Key features include Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers before applying predictive models.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Time-series visualization to understand trends and seasonality.

Correlation heatmaps to analyze relationships between features.

Moving averages and volatility measures to assess stock behavior.

🏗️ Machine Learning Models Implemented

The project tests multiple regression models to identify the best-performing approach:

Linear Regression (Baseline Model)

Random Forest Regressor (Ensemble Model)

Gradient Boosting Regressor (Boosting Model)

🏆 Model Performance Evaluation

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared (R²)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

🔹 Linear Regression

MSE: 0.1114

R²: 0.5470

MAE: 0.2687

🔹 Random Forest Regressor

MSE: 0.1339

R²: 0.4556

MAE: 0.1575

🔹 Gradient Boosting Regressor

MSE: 0.1369

R²: 0.4436

MAE: 0.1505

🔎 Feature Importance & Explainability

To interpret the model’s decision-making process, feature importance analysis is conducted using:

SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)

Permutation Importance

The most significant features impacting stock prices include:
✅ Opening Price✅ Previous Day’s Closing Price✅ Trading Volume

🚀 Future Enhancements

Implement Deep Learning models (LSTMs, RNNs) for improved prediction accuracy.

Incorporate real-time stock market data for dynamic forecasting.

Enhance the feature set with macroeconomic indicators, news sentiment analysis, and technical indicators.
